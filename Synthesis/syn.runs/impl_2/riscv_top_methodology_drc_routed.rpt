2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CLKC-2#1 Warning

Clock UART_CLK must not have the clock latency set when it is not propagated.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-2#2 Warning
Clocking latency set by user

Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/FSM0/timer_reset_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[0]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[10]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[11]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[12]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[13]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[14]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[15]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[16]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[17]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[18]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[19]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[1]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[20]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[2]/CLR, riscv_button_debouncer_inst/DD0/T0/Q_reg_reg[3]/CLR (the first 15 of 21 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance u_top_core/u_inst_cache/u_icache_inst/byte10_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance u_top_core/u_inst_cache/u_icache_inst/byte11_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance u_top_core/u_inst_cache/u_icache_inst/byte14_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks UART_CLK and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 10 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#3 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 12 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#4 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 13 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#5 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-36#1 Warning
Invalid Generated Clock due to missing edge propagation  
There is no rising/falling edge propagation between master clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 to generated clock UART_CLK
